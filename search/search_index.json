This article covers how to install Mindustry on different platforms and situations. Typical Setup This is your typical, run-of-the-mill setup process. Desktop Steam As of recent, you can now buy the game on Steam if you would like to support Anuke! Itch.io Visit the game's itch.io page , then download a copy of the game from there. Once the .zip file is downloaded, unzip it. Usually that is just done by opening it like normal. When it's done, navigate to the folder it extracted into. Windows : simply open desktop-release.exe . MacOS : run Mindustry.app. Linux : run Mindustry . If you have JRE already installed (which is recommended), you can also run desktop-release.jar on Windows and Linux. Android Play Store There are two different versions of Mindustry on the Play Store; Mindsutry and Mindustry Classic. If you want to get the latest releases of Mindustry, go get Mindustry . Otherwise, if you want the old classic version, you can get Mindustry Classic . F-Droid F-Droid is an open source app repository that makes sure all apps are secure and not tampered with. First, you will have to download the F-Droid app here. After it has installed, you can install Mindustry from there. Notice: You will usually get the latest updates through the Play Store before F-Droid. iOS The latest released builds are available on iOS devices only for purchase. For Contributors If you would like to contribute to the game's source code, the best way to go is to compile the game yourself. To compile it yourself: If you haven't already, install at least JRE and JDK 8. Open a terminal in the root directory, then run these commands: For Windows: Running: gradlew desktop:run Building: gradlew desktop:dist For Linux: Running: ./gradlew desktop:run Building: ./gradlew desktop:dist For Server builds, replace desktop with server .

Cost [Items] Cost is how much time an item adds to the time it takes to build a block that uses it. One cost = one tick added to build time. For example, the Battery requires 8CP , 30LE , and 4SI . The build time is processed like this: (0.6 * 8) + (0.9 * 30) + (0.9 * 8) = 39 Therefore, it takes 39 ticks to build a Battery by yourself. Hardness [Items] The time it takes to mine one item is partially dependent on the hardness of an item. Sand is the least hardest, while Thorium is the hardest. [needs correction] For example, mining Copper with your Mining Laser gets you copper much faster than when mining Thorium. That is because Thorium is harder than Copper. Radioactivity [Items] Radioactivity is the potency of the material in nuclear-based blocks like the RTG. In said block, Thorium generates more electricity than Phase because it is much more radioactive. Flammability [Items, Liquids] As it suggests, it is the measure of flammability of an item or liquid. It is also the speed at which it burns and the speed at which it spreads across blocks that are made of it, and enemies which are hit by it as a projectile. For example, Plastanium burns slower than coal , which burns much slower than Pyratite . Furthermore, when Pyratite is used as ammo, it will burn enemies faster and stronger than Blast Compound . When Lava is used as an ammo in the Wave, it will burn enemies unlike Cryofluid or Oil . Tip: Make sure distribution blocks (Conveyors, Vaults, Bridges) that contain flammable or explosive materials are protected and kept away from potential damage, like a Reactor or enemy path. For example, if a Reactor explodes near a conveyor with Coal, the majority of the conveyor will immediately explode because of the Coal on it. Explosiveness [Items, Liquids] As it suggests, it is the measure of explosiveness of an item or liquid. That is most useful in an ammunition application, where the most explosive item (not liquid) will deal the largest damage over the largest area. Blast Compound is the most explosive item as its name, \"Blast\", suggests. Oil is the most and only explosive liquid. If shot from a Wave and set on fire using Pyratite or Lava, it will burn and explode enemies that are around it. The same thing goes for Liquid Tanks and the such that are filled with it. Tip: Keep explosive material protected and separate from your Core or any exposed lines, unless it is needed. It is highly explosive and when triggered, will deal damage to surrounding blocks as well. Read the previous tip, too. Heat Capacity [Liquids] Heat capacity is the measure of the effectiveness of a liquid in absorbing and dissipating heat. The higher the Heat Cap., the faster it will cool things like the Thorium Reactor down. Temperature [Liquids] The temperature of a liquid. Viscosity [Liquids] Viscosity determines the speed at which a liquid flows. A higher viscosity means it flows slower, while a lower one means it flows much faster. Status Effect [Liquids] The status effect of the liquid is passed on to an entity that is hit by it or is standing on it. Melting Lava has the \"melting\" status effect, which means that enemies that are hit by it (from a Wave) or are standing on a puddle of it will start burning and melting. Tarred With the \"tarred\" status effect, enemies will move slower and be more susceptible to fire. Freezing Enemies will move extremely slow as they freeze. This is useful for slowing down swift air enemies to make them easier to shoot.","title":"Characteristics"},{"location":"characteristics/#characteristics","text":"NOTICE: A lot of the content on this page is not up-to-date and refers to an older version of the game.","title":"Characteristics"},{"location":"characteristics/#cost-items","text":"Cost is how much time an item adds to the time it takes to build a block that uses it.

For PC, you can get the game on itch.io. For Android, you can get the game on Google Play. For iOS, you can buy it on the App Store. How do I play multiplayer with my friends/enemies? If you're on the same wifi or hotspot network, it should be easy. Start playing a game, open the pause menu and press \"host game\" button. This will make your game available to everyone in the same network. To join this game from another device, click \"join game\" from the main menu. If another player is hosting, the game should pop up in the list of servers. I can't find my friend's multiplayer game! If you are sure that you are on the same network, and you still can't find their game, considering using a wifi hotspot instead of a public network. Some public wifi networks simply do not allow server discovery. If you're using a wifi hotspot and you still can't find a friend's game, you could try connecting directly via IP. Instead of looking for the game, find the internal IP of the hosting device (look up how to find it for the specific device you're using), and have the other player type in that IP in the \"add server\" dialog. How can I play with someone across networks? You need to port forward and share your IP with the other players. See the guide here. Consider using a public server from #servers. How do I set up a dedicated server? / How do I port forward? See this guide. Can PC players play with iOS/Android players? Yes, Mindustry is fully cross-platform. As long as all the devices are running the same version of Mindustry, any device can connect to any other device. How do I import a map? First of all, you need to make sure that the map is compatible with your game version. If you're running Mindustry 4.0, you need a .msav map file. Once you download the file onto your device, open the Mindustry main menu. Select Editor -> Import Map (on the top of the screen). Find the directory that the map is in, select the file and press \"open\". Note that the file chooser will only display files with an .msav extension. If you can't find the file, make sure that you're looking in the right place and that the extension is correct. Note that Discord may sometimes remove the extension from files when downloading, so you'll need to open your file browser of choice and add the extension manually. How do I export a map file? Open your map in the editor. Open the menu (esc on PC, or the hamburger button on mobile), then press \"export\". Select a directory, type in a filename and press \"save\". I don't like Mindustry 4.0 for some reason, what do I do? Just download Mindustry Classic for the old experience. It's identical to build 3.5 40, albeit with some minor bugfixes. PC/Android APK: https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry-classic You can also find it by searching \"mindustry classic\" on the Google Play store. Does Mindustry run on a Raspberry Pi? While the game itself could theoretically support it, no, it does not support the Raspberry Pi. However, the dedicated server will run on a Pi as long as you have the right version of Java installed. Note that the 3.5/Classic dedicated server will not run on a Pi; only 4.0 and above is supported. What is an IP and how do I find out what mine is? In extremely simplified terms, an IP as a unique identifier of your computer on the internet. You can connect to someone's Mindustry server by their IP. The simplest way to find your IP is to google my ip. Where is the game's source code? On GitHub: https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry Did Anuke make the game alone? For the most part, yes. Music, graphics and programming are done by me. Translations are made by contributors from the community. Some people also contribute to the game's code by submitting pull requests on GitHub. These people are marked with a Contributor role on Discord. There are many people who contribute to the wiki/documentation as well. How do I join the Google Play beta program? Open the Google Play page for Mindustry, scroll to the bottom of the page and tap 'join beta'. Beta builds can take some time to become available after tapping the button. Be patient. I do not control how fast this happens; it is handled automatically by Google. I can't connect to servers / My game is out of date. What do I do? If you're using Google Play on Android, wait for an update to become available. I always upload builds before the announcement is made, but Google may take hours to process it. Be patient. If you're on iOS, it's the same deal, except you may need to wait a bit longer. iOS builds take a longer time to release, and Apple takes 1-2 days to verify each release even after I upload it. If you're using the desktop version, just go on itch.io using the links at the top of this channel and download the game again. Updating should not reset progress. Are Anuke and Anuken different people? They are very well the same person. Anuke(n) uses \"Anuken\" when \"Anuke\" is taken. I usually use Anuken when Anuke is taken as a username. -Anuken Why are you charging for the game on Steam and iOS when it is available for free? The game is being charged for on Steam and iOS because it is one way of supporting Anuke, and it has features not available on the free versions, such as: A map, mod, and schematic browser Secure, seamless multiplayer using Steam Multiplayer (eliminates the need to port-forward) Publicly visible servers at startup Achievements Stat tracking Cloud saves and progress transfer using Steam Steam community On the App Store, distributing the game there costs a lot, as a developer will need a Mac, and a $100/year developer license to do so. Such expenses are covered by charging for the game on there. How can I contribute to the game? The easiest way is to give constructive feedback and discussion (preferably about the game) in our Discord Server. Report bugs that you find on the GitHub repository. Please remember to use the templates properly , as doing so will make your issue more organized and follow a common pattern, making Anuke's job easier. If you know how to program in Java, feel free to help Anuke out and fix said bugs, then open a PR. Donations to Anuke are open on the Itch.io page if you would like to give a monetary contribution. You can also buy the game on Steam. If you are fluent in a language that Mindustry doesn't support yet, or if you want to contribute to the ones already there, stop by the #translations channel, and ask about it. You can contribute to the current bundles and open a PR in the game's repo. If you want to contribute to this wiki, please contact Anuke or Luxray5474.

There are many ways to use the modding API, depending on exactly what you want to do, and how far you're willing to go to do it. You could just resprite existing game content, you can create new game content with the simpler Json API (which is the main focus of this documentation), you can add custom sounds (or reuse existing ones). It's possible to add maps to compaing mode, and add scripts to program special behavior into your mod, like custom effects. Sharing your mod is as simple as giving someone your project directory; mods are also cross platfrom to any platform that supports them. Realistically speaking you'll want to use GitHub , you should also checkout the Example Mod repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Anuken/ExampleMod To make mods all you really need is any computer with a text editor. Directory Structure Your project directory should look something like this: project \u251c\u2500\u2500 mod.json \u251c\u2500\u2500 content \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 items \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 blocks \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 mechs \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 liquids \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 units \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 zones \u251c\u2500\u2500 maps \u251c\u2500\u2500 bundles \u251c\u2500\u2500 sounds \u251c\u2500\u2500 schematics \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts \u251c\u2500\u2500 sprites-override \u2514\u2500\u2500 sprites mod.json (required) metadata file for your mod, content/* directories for game Content , maps/ directory for Zone maps, bundles/ directory for Bundles , sounds/ directory for Sound files, schematics/ directory for Schematic files, scripts/ directory for Scripts , sprites-override/ Sprites directory for overriding ingame content, sprites/ Sprites directory for your content, Every platform has a different user application data directory, and this is where your mods should be placed: Linux: ~/.local/share/Mindustry/mods/ Steam: steam/steamapps/common/Mindustry/mods/ Windows: %appdata%/Mindustry/mods/ Apple: ~/Library/Application Support/Mindustry/mods/ Note that your filenames should be lowercased and hyphen separated: correct: my-custom-block.json incorrect: My Custom Block.json Hjson Mindustry uses Hjson , which for anyone who knows Json, is simply a superset of the very popular serialization language known as Json . \u2013 This means that any valid Json will work, but you get extra useful stuff: # single line comment // single line comment /* multiline comment */ key1: single line string key2: ''' multiline string ''' key3: [ value 1 value 2 value 3 ] key4: { key1: string key2: 0 } If you don't know any of those words. \u2013 A serialization language, is simply a language which encodes information for a program, and encode means to translate informantion from one form to another, and in this case, to translate text into Java data structures. mod.json At the root of your project directory, you must have a mod.json which defines the basic metadata for your project. This file can also be (optionally) named mod.hjson to potentially help your text editor pick better syntax highlighting. name: Mod Name displayName: Mod [red]Name[] author: Yourself description: This is a useless description. version: \"1.0\" minGameVersion: \"100.3\" dependencies: [ ] name will be used to reference to your mod, so name it carefully; displayName this will be used as a display name for the UI, which you can use to add formatting to said name; description of the mod will be rendered in the ingame mod manager, so keep it short and to the point; dependencies is optional, if you want to know more about that, go to the dependencies section; minGameVersion is the minimum build version of the game. Content At the root of your project directory you can have a content/ directory, and this is where all the Json/Hjson data goes. Inside of content/ you have subdirectories for the various kinds of content, these are the current common ones: content/items/ for items , like copper and surge-alloy ; content/blocks/ for blocks , like turrets and floors; content/mechs/ for mechs , like tau and glaive ; content/liquids/ for liquids , like water and slag ; content/units/ for flying or ground units , like reaper and dagger ; content/zones/ for zones , configuration of campaign maps. Note that each one of these subdirectories needs a specific content type. The filenames of these files is important, because the stem name of your path (filename without the extension) is used to reference it. [ new Jan 03 ] Furthermore the files within these content/<content-type>/* directories may be arbitrarly nested into other sub-directories of any name, to help you organize them further, for example: content/items/metals/iron.hjson , which would respectively create an item named iron . The content of these files will tend to look something like this: type: TypeOfThing name: Name Of Thing description: Description of thing. # ... more fields here ... field type notes type String Content type of this object. name String Displayed name of content. description String Displayed description of content. Other fields included will be the fields of the type itself. Types Types have numerous fields, but the important one is type ; this is a special field used by the content parser, that changes which type your object is. A Router type can't be a Turret type , as they're just completely different. Types extend each other, so if MissileBulletType extends BasicBulletType , you'll have access to all the fields of BasicBulletType inside of MissileBulletType like damage , lifetime and speed . Fields are case sensitive: hitSize =/= hitsize . What you can expect a field to do is up to the specific type, some types do absolutely nothing with their fields, and work mostly as a base types will extend from. One such type is Block . type can be refer to the actual type field of the object. A type may also refer to other things like float is a type so it means you can type 0.3 in a field. Here you can see, the type of the top level object is Revenant , but the type of the bullet is BulletType so you can use MissileBulletType , because MissileBulletType extends BulletType . type: Revenant weapon: { bullet: { type: MissileBulletType damage: 9000 } } Tech Tree Much like type there exist another magical field known as research which can go at the root of any block object to put it in the techtree. research: duo This would put your block after duo in the techtree, and to put it after your own mods block you would write your <block-name> , a mod name prefix is only required if you're using the content from another mod. Research cost will be 30 + requirements * 6 , where requirements is the build cost of your block. (in otherwords you can't set requirements and research cost individually) Sprites All you need to make sprites, is an image editor that supports transparency (aka: not paint). Block sprites should be 32 * size , so a 2x2 block would require a 64x64 image. Images must be .png files with 32 bit depth. Sprites can simply be dropped in the sprites/ subdirectory. The content parser will look through it recursively, so you can organize them how ever you feel. Content is going to look for sprites relative to it's own name. content/blocks/my-hail.json has the name my-hail and similarly sprites/my-hail.png has the name my-hail , so it'll be used by this content. Content may look for multiple sprites. my-hail could be a turret, and it could look for the suffix <name>-heat and what this means is it'll look for my-hail-heat . You can find all the vanilla sprites here: https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/tree/master/core/assets-raw/sprites Another thing to know about sprites is that some of them are modified by the game. Turrets specifically have a black border added to them, so you must account for that while making your sprites, leaving transparent space around turrets for example: Ripple [new Nov 26 ] to override ingame content sprites, you can simply put them in sprites-override/ . Sound Custom sounds can be added through the modding system by dropping them in the sounds/ subdirectory. It doesn't matter where you put them. Two formats are needed: .ogg required for Desktop/Android .mp3 required for iOS Just like any other assets, you reference them by the stem of your filenames, so pewpew.ogg and pewpew.mp3 can be referenced with pewpew from a field of type Sound . Here's a list of built-in sounds: artillery back bang beam bigshot boom break build buttonClick click conveyor corexplode door drill empty explosionbig explosion fire flame2 flame laserbig laser machine message missile pew place press release respawning respawn shootBig shoot shootSnap shotgun spark splash spray thruster unlock wave windowHide Dependencies You can add dependencies to your mod by simple adding other mods name in your mod.json : dependencies: [ other-mod-name not-a-mod ] The name of dependencies are lower-cased and spaces are replaced with - hyphens, for example Other MOD NamE becomes other-mod-name . To reference the other mods assets, you must prefix the asset with the other mods name: other-mod-name-not-copper would reference not-copper in other-mod-name other-mod-name-angry-dagger would reference angry-dagger in other-mod-name not-a-mod-angry-dagger would reference angry-dagger in not-a-mod Bundles An optional addition to your mod is called bundles. The main use of bundles are give translations of your content, but there's no reason you couldn't use them in English. These are plaintext files which go in the bundles/ subdirectory, and they should be named something like bundle_ru.properties (for Russian). The contents of this file is very simple: block.example-mod-silver-wall.name = \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 block.example-mod-silver-wall.description = \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0430. If you've read the first few sections of this guide, you'll spot it right away: <content type>.<mod name>-<content name>.name <content type>.<mod name>-<content name>.description Notes: mod/content names are lowercased and hyphen separated.

[name] sets the color by name, there's a few built-in colors ; [#rrggbb] / [#rrggbbaa] sets the color by hex value, with each value being anything from 00 to ff : rr is the red value, gg is the green value, bb is the blue value, aa is the alpha value; [] sets the color back to the previous color; [[ escapes the left bracket, so you can write [[red] to write and it'll render as [red] . Notes: erros/unknown colors will be silently ignored. Example: [red]red [#ff0000]full-red [#ff000066]half-red [#ff000033]half-half-red [#00ff00]green []half-half-red Built-in Colors [clear]clear [black]black [white]white [lightgray]lightgray [gray]gray [darkgray]darkgray [blue]blue [navy]navy [royal]royal [slate]slate [sky]sky [cyan]cyan [teal]teal [green]green [acid]acid [lime]lime [forest]forest [olive]olive [yellow]yellow [gold]gold [goldenrod]goldenrod [orange]orange [brown]brown [tan]tan [brick]brick [red]red [scarlet]scarlet [coral]coral [salmon]salmon [pink]pink [magenta]magenta [purple]purple [violet]violet [maroon]maroon Schematic Fields that require the type Schematic can either take a built-in loadout (see the Zone section) a base64 string, or the stem name of a .msch file in the schematics/ subdirectory. As of now, the only purpose of schematics is to give a zone a loadout. Scripts Scripting in Mindustry is done with the Rhino JavaScript runtime. Scripts may be added to your mod by putting them in scripts/ . Using the built-in extendContent function, you can extend existing Java types from JS, using allowed classes which are injected into your namespace. For example: scripts/silo.js // create a simple shockwave effect const siloLaunchEffect = newEffect(20, e => { // color goes from white to light gray Draw.color(Color.white, Color.lightGray, e.fin()); // line thickness goes from 3 to 0 Lines.stroke(e.fout() * 3); // draw a circle whose radius goes from 0 to 100 Lines.circle(e.x, e.y, e.fin() * 100); }); // create the block type const silo = extendContent(Block, \"scatter-silo\", { // override the method to build configuration buildConfiguration(tile, table) { table.addImageButton( Icon.arrowUpSmall, Styles.clearTransi, // configure the tile to signal that it has been // pressed (this sync on client to server) run(() => tile.configure(0)) ).size(50); }, // override configure event configured(tile, value) { // make sure this silo has the items it needs to fire if (tile.entity.cons.valid()) { // make this effect occur at the tile location Effects.effect(siloLaunchEffect, tile); // create 10 bullets at this tile's location with // random rotation and velocity/lifetime for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Calls.createBullet( Bullets.flakExplosive, tile.getTeam(), tile.drawx(), tile.drawy(), Mathf.random(360), Mathf.random(0.5, 1.0), Mathf.random(0.2, 1.0) ); } // triggering consumption makes it use up the // items it requires tile.entity.cons.trigger(); } } }); content/blocks/scatter-silo.hjson localizedName: \"Scatter Silo\" description: \"A player-activatable block that scatters bullets everywhere upon use.\" category: turret size: 2 update: true solid: true hasItems: true configurable: true requirements: [ \"graphite/75\" \"titanium/30\" ] consumes: { items: { items: [ \"scrap/10\" ] } } More examples: entity-lib GitHub Once you have a mod of some kind, you'll want to actually share it, and you may even want to work with other people on it, and to do that you can use GitHub . If you don't know what Git (or GitHub) is at all, then you should look into GitHub Desktop , otherwise simply use your favorite command line tool or text editor plugin. All you need understand is how to open repositories on GitHub, stage and commit changes in your local repository, and push changes to the GitHub repository. Once your project is on GitHub, there are three ways to share it: with the endpoint, for example Anuken/ExampleMod , which could then be typed in the ingame GitHub interface, and that would download it; with the zip file, for example https://github.com/Anuken/ExampleMod/archive/master.zip , which would download the repository as a zip file, and put in mod directory (unzipping is not required); add the typic/tags mindustry-mod on your repository, which should cause the #mods Discord bot to pick it up and render it in it's listh. FAQ time in game is calculated through ticks ; ticks sometimes called frames , are assumed to be 60/1 second; tilesize is 8 units internally; to calculate range out of lifetime and speed you can do lifetime * speed = range ; Abstract what is abstract ? all you need to know about abstract types, is this is a Java specific term, which means you cannot instantiate/initialize this specific type by itself. If you do so you'll probably get an \"initialization exception\" of some kind; what is a NullPointerException ? This is an error message that indicates a field is null and shouldn't be null, meaning one of the required fields may be missing; bleeding-edge what is bleeding-edge ? This is the developer version of Mindustry, specifically it's refering to the Github master branch. Changes on bleeding-edge usually make it into Mindustry in the next release. Change Log This is a log of changes done on the Mindustry Master branch that affected the modding API.

Sprites: <name> the main sprite for the block. Consumers This type is commonly used in block type with it's field consumes , it's a type that allows your block to consume something, and how this field works is up to the specific type extension you're using. field type notes item String shorthand for items items ConsumeItems consume a number of different items liquid ConsumeLiquid consume a single liquid power float or ConsumePower consume or buffer power powerBuffered float amount of power buffered Notes: you shouldn't have power and powerBuffered . For example with ConsumeItems and ConsumeLiquid : items: { items: [ copper/10 surge-alloy/5 ] booster: true optional: true } liquid: { water/1.0 } Consume Abstract type which defines a type of resource that a block can consume. field type default notes optional boolean consumer will not influence consumer validity. booster boolean consumer will be displayed as a boost input. update boolean true ConsumeItems Extends Consume Type to consume ItemStacks. field type items [ ItemStack ] ConsumeLiquid Extends Consume Type to consume a LiquidStack. field type default notes liquid String the name of liquid type consumed amount float amount used per frame timePeriod float 60 how much time is taken to use this liquid, example: a normal ConsumeLiquid with 10/s and a 10 second timePeriod would display as 100 seconds , but without a time override it would display as 10 liquid/second . This is used for generic crafters. ConsumePower Extends Consume Type to consume or buffer power. field type notes usage float The maximum amount of power which can be processed per tick. This might influence efficiency or load a buffer capacity float The maximum power capacity in power units. buffered boolean True if the module can store power.

These blocks wont appear on a map unless you've built a map to support them. Floor Extends Block Type used for floors themselves or extended to make ores and other things. field type default notes variants int 3 number of different variant regions to use. edge String stone edge fallback, used mainly for ores. speedMultiplier float 1 multiplies unit velocity by this when walked on. dragMultiplier float 0 multiplies unit drag by this when walked on. damageTaken float 0 damage taken per tick on this tile. drownTime float 0 how many ticks it takes to drown on this. walkEffect Effect ripple effect when walking on this floor . drownUpdateEffect Effect bubble effect displayed when drowning on this floor . status StatusEffect none status effect applied when walking on. statusDuration float 60 intensity of applied status effect. liquidDrop Liquid liquids that drop from this block, used for pumps. itemDrop Item item that drops from this block, used for drills. isLiquid boolean whether this block can be drowned in. playerUnmineable boolean false block cannot be mined by players if true. blendGroup Block this group of blocks that this block does not draw edges on. updateEffect Effect none effect displayed when randomly updated. attributes Attributes array of affinities to certain things. oreDefault boolean false whether this ore generates in maps by default. oreScale float 24 ore generation param, for example thorium is 25.38 , copper is 23.47 . oreThreshold float 0.828 ore generation param, for example thorium is 0.882 , copper is 0.81 .

All turrets shoot BulletType , and this means LiquidTurret can shoot MissileBulletType and ItemTurret can shoot LiquidBulletType . Turret Abstract type which extends Block The purpose of a turret type is to be a Block that shoots bullets. Turret is the base type for all turrets, it's abstract meaning it shouldn't be used directly, but everything which extends it will get it's fields. field type default notes heatColor Color turretHeat The color of the -heat sprite. shootEffect Effect none An effect fired on tile in the direction the turret is aiming when it shoots. smokeEffect Effect none An effect fired on tile in the direction the turret is aiming when it shoots. ammoUseEffect Effect none An effect fired on the tile, when ammo is consumed. shootSound Sound shoot A sound created from the tile when a bullet is fired. ammoPerShot int 1 The amount of ammo used per shot. ammoEjectBack float 1 The eject angle of shells in radians. range float 50 The range at which the turret can target enemies. Range is in tilesize so 8 is 1 tile. reload float 10 The amount of ticks it takes to reload. inaccuracy float 0 The degrees of inaccuracy. shots int 1 The numbers of bullets fired at once. spread float 4 The angular spread of multiple bullets when shot. recoil float 1 The recoil of the turret when fired. restitution float 0.02 The restitution from recoil after shooting.

Used in Swarmer for example. targetAir boolean true Whether this target can target air units. targetGround boolean true Whether this turret can target ground units or blocks. Defaults: field default priority turret update true solid true layer turret group turrets outlineIcon true Sprites: <name> the turret sprite, <name>-heat the heat map. Sprites-Override: block-<1..> global turret base override, where the number is the turrets size. Can be used to override existing turret bases, as well as adding larger ones. CooledTurret Extends Turret \u2013 This is a base type that turrets which use Liquid to cool themselves extend from. field type default notes coolantMultiplier float 5 How much reload is lowered by for each unit of liquid of heat capacity. coolEffect Effect shoot Notes: doesn't take flammable fluid doesn't take hot fluid ItemTurret Extends CooledTurret This type is a turret that uses items as ammo. The key to the ammo field should be the name of an Item , while the value may be any Built-in Bullets or a BulletType itself. type: ItemTurret ammo: { copper: standardCopper metaglass: { type: MissileBulletType damage: 2 } surge-alloy: { type: LiquidBulletType damage: 3 } } Here we're using copper to shoot standardCopper (built-in bullet) and metalglass to shoot a custom bullet of type MissileBulletType . field type default notes maxAmmo int 30 ammo { String: BulletType } String is the name of an Item , which will be used to select the type of bullet which will be shot. Defaults: field default hasItems true LiquidTurret Extends Turret This type is just a turret that uses liquid as ammo.

Zone Extends Content A Zone is a type that takes a map (named the same as the json's filename) and puts it into campaign. (a zone isn't a map) Every Zone has a Generator , which once initialized, MapGenerator will run through the map and do initialization related stuff. One of those notable things, is deleting all cores on in your map and placing a loadout on top of a random one of them. This allows your campaign map to have multiple core locations. (it doesn't matter which core was previously on the map, loadout will dictate that) It is entirely possible to produce a custom schematic, but take note that this schematic must contain a CoreBlock within it. field type default notes baseLaunchCost [ ItemStack ] launchCost [ ItemStack ] startingItems [ ItemStack ] Items you start with on the map. conditionWave int alwaysUnlocked boolean false Whether this map is always unlocked launchPeriod int 10 Rate of waves at which the core may be launched. loadout Schematic basicShard Core layout placed by MapGenerators. resources [ String ] Array of item names. requirements [ Objective ] An array of requirements to unlock configuration. configureObjective Objective ZoneWave 15 defaultStartingItems [ ItemStack ] Sprites: zone-<name> preview <name>-zone preview Built-in loadouts: basicShard bXNjaAB4nD2K2wqAIBiD5ymibnoRn6YnEP1BwUMoBL19FuJ2sbFvUFgYZDaJsLeQrkinN9UJHImsNzlYE7WrIUastuSbnlKx2VJJt+8IQGGKdfO/8J5yrGJSMegLg+YUIA== advancedShard bXNjaAB4nD2LjQqAIAyET7OMIOhFfJqeYMxBgSkYCL199gu33fFtB4tOwUTaBCP5QpHFzwtl32DahBeKK1NwPq8hoOcUixwpY+CUxe3XIwBbB/pa6tadVCUP02hgHvp5vZq/0b7pBHPYFOQ= basicFoundation bXNjaAB4nD1OSQ6DMBBzFhVu8BG+0X8MQyoiJTNSukj8nlCi2Adbtg/GA4OBF8oB00rvyE/9ykafqOIw58A7SWRKy1ZiShhZ5RcOLZhYS1hefQ1gRIeptH9jq/qW2lvc1d2tgWsOfVX/tOwE86AYBA== basicNucleus bXNjaAB4nD2MUQqAIBBEJy0s6qOLdJXuYNtCgikYBd2+LNmdj308hkGHtkId7M4YFns4mk/yfB4a48602eDI+mlNznu0FMPFd0wYKCaewl8F0EOueqM+yKSLVfJrNKWnSw/FZGzEGXFG9sy/px4gEBW1 Built-in zones: nuclearComplexe desolateRift tarFields overgrowth stainedMountains frozenForest saltFlats desertWastes groundZero StatusEffect Not be be confused with Effect , a status effect will give an entity special properties.

It's possible to add maps to compaing mode, and add scripts to program special behavior into your mod, like custom effects.

Dedicated Servers Dedicated servers are standalone, headless versions of the game that are focused only on providing a means for people to play Multiplayer. They are usually run on a computer as a separate program rather than in-game, and are operated from the terminal. These are usually stronger than a local LAN server as they have more resources available to them to support more than two or three players, and can be run 24/7. They are also more versatile and powerful in that they have many commands to provide the administrator with more control over it, and they can easily be modded to fit the administrator's needs. You can connect to one using the \"Join Game\" button under the \"Play\" menu. Unlike local LAN servers, you will have to enter the host's IP address and port. Also unlike local LAN servers, once you add a server, it will automatically show up on your server list when you open it, and the game will automatically check the server's status. To establish a dedicated server, a dedicated Linux or Windows machine is highly recommended. If you haven't already, install at least JRE and JDK 8. Download the desired server release from itch.io , or compile one yourself. Open a terminal or TTY session then change cd to the directory the JAR is placed in. Run java -jar server.jar using Command Prompt (on Windows) or your favorite terminal (on Linux and Mac). The commands are explained in the help command. Start hosting a map with host <mapname> [mode] after you configured your server. If you are using Windows to run your server, use your favorite search engine to look up how to add rules to your Windows Firewall, as it blocks that port most of the time. Make sure to allow port 6567 TCP and UDP . If you want your server to be publicly available around the world, then read the following. If not, then you are done! It is recommended and that you use a domain name or DNS service to mask your IP for public servers for ease of use, or even better, use a cloud service e.g. Amazon AWS or a dedicated server/VM from a hosting provider such as Linode or DigitalOcean, which is much safer. Do your research , and determine which option best fits your needs. About Runnung A Dedicated Server At Home Most importantly, never share your public IP with the public if your hosting from your home, unless you acknowledge the implications of doing so! Your public IP is tied to your household, and if it falls into the wrong hands, it can be used to easily find your approximate location, even down to the city or block you live in. There is more that can happen; such as DoS attacks, data and information exploitation and collection, and unwanted access to other open ports in your network. Exercise caution, do your research, and use a VPN if possible. Find the make/model of your router. This is usually on a sticker on the bottom or back of the router. Use your favorite search engine to search 'port forward [your router make/model/name here]' and use the guide to foward port 6567 TCP and UDP . These instructions are different for every router, so be sure to read your guide thoroughly! You can use a service such as You Get Signal to check if you have done your portforwarding correctly. Local LAN & Steam Servers A local LAN or Steam server is a server that is built into the game, and can be started using the \"Host Multiplayer Game\" button in the in-game menu. It is meant to be simple and straightforward, for sessions between a few players under a LAN network (aka in your household's WiFi network). It is not really meant for several players, as it takes more and more resources from your device to be able to use it that way; for that you will need a dedicated server mentioned above. It can only run when the game is open, and is immediately terminated when it is closed. You can connect to one using the \"Join Game\" button under the \"Play\" menu. Unlike dedicated servers, your device will automatically find the host device and it will ususally appear in the server list without you having to enter the host's IP address in.","title":"Servers"},{"location":"servers/#servers","text":"Servers are a large part of Mindustry in that they offer the ability to play the game with other people.

Allows transporting items over up to 3 tiles of any terrain or building.\" General Internal Name bridge-conveyor Solid Yes Health 40 Size 1x1 Build Time 0.08 seconds Build Cost x4 x4 Items Item Capacity 10 items Bridge Mechanics A bridge consists of multiple directionally connected bridge blocks. Each bridge block can have up to one destination set, and an unlimited number of incoming connections from other bridge blocks. Each bridge block has its own separate inventory of 10 items, such that a bridge consisting of three chained bridge blocks has a total capacity of up to 30 items. Bridges cannot be unloaded by Unloaders. Once a bridge block is placed, you may set its destination to any other bridge block up to four tiles away in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) by selecting the bridge block and then pressing the bridge block you want to connect it to. You may not set a bridge block's destination to a bridge which it already has an incoming connection from. If you wish to change the direction of a bridge connection, you must first disconnect the source block by pressing it twice. Bridge blocks which have a destination set will accept items from adjacent blocks in any direction except the direction their destination is in. For example, a simple source bridge with its destination set to another bridge block four tiles its right will accept items from adjacent blocks on its top, left, and bottom, but not from an adjacent block on its right. This restriction applies even if the adjacent block in question is another bridge block with its destination set to the first block. Note that this restriction only applies to adjacent blocks. In the previous example, the bridge block on the left would accept items from an incoming bridge connection from its right without issue, just so long source block for that connection had at least one tile of empty space between it and the bridge block on the left. Bridge blocks which do not have a destination set will not accept items from any source except incoming connections from other bridges. Instead, they will actively output their contents into available adjacent blocks in any direction that they do not have a bridge connection coming from. For example, a bridge block with no destination set and three incoming bridge connections from its top, left, and right will only emit its contents to the block below it, but a bridge block with no destination set and only one incoming bridge connection from its left will output items to any available space on its top, right, and bottom.
